# Smart-Home-Management
This project was completed in an exam scenario (2.30hr, course notes only) and uploaded as-is for demonstration purposes.

## Scenario
Implement a core part of a Smart Home Device Management system using Object-Oriented Programming principles. You will focus on a particular kind of smart device (SmartLight), but design your solution so that other device types (e.g., SmartThermostat, SmartDoorLock) could be easily added later. Create a DeviceSearch class to support the system for searches. Each search method should be static and accept and return an ArrayList of the appropriate type. Unit Test the application.
